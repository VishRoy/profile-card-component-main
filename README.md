### What I learned

I learned how to use multiple background images.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div id="example1"></div>
```

```css
#example1 {
  background-image: url(img_flwr.gif), url(paper.gif);
  background-position: right bottom, left top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - CSS allows you to add multiple background images for an element, through the background-image property.

The different background images are separated by commas, and the images are stacked on top of each other, where the first image is closest to the viewer.
